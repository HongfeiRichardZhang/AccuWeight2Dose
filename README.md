**AccuWeight2Dose** is an iOS app designed to estimate a patient's body weight using augmented reality (AR) and provide accurate medication dosage recommendations based on the estimated weight. It aims to assist clinicians in situations where precise weight measurement is unavailable, particularly in emergency or pediatric scenarios.

> 🚧 Minimum Viable Product: AR functionality implemented. LiDAR-based measurement is under development.

## 🧠 Motivation

In many clinical situations (e.g. ER, ICU, field medicine), it is challenging to obtain a patient's accurate weight, which can lead to incorrect drug dosing. AccuWeight2Dose offers a vision-based alternative by utilizing ARKit to assess patient body dimensions and estimate weight — providing doctors and paramedics a rapid tool to guide dosage calculation.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 iOS-native app with ARKit integration
- 🔍 AR body frame scanning (proof of concept)
- 🧮 Basic weight estimation algorithm
- 💊 Dose calculator (planned)
- 📏 LiDAR integration (in progress)
